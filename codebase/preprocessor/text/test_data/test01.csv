""" 25-Mar-2018 16:03:00  Exam: CT ABDOMEN w & PELVIS w   Indications: ED CENTER 1-CT Abd/Pel constipation, r/o SBO   ORIGINAL REPORT - 25-Mar-2018 16:41:00   EXAM:  CT scan of the Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast      COMPARISON:  None.      IMPRESSION:   1. Malignant appearing diffuse mural thickening of the stomach with additional infiltrative processes outside the stomach walls. Given the history of breast cancer, this may all be metastatic disease. Primary gastric malignancy as well as lymphoma would also be on the differential.   2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.   3. Mildly dilated right renal collecting system with ureter dilated down into the pelvis but no obstructing masses seen.   4. Relatively large stool burden throughout the colon. No obstructing mass to bowel.      FINDINGS: Diffuse malignant appearing wall thickening of the stomach involving the cardia, fundus, body and antrum. Masslike soft tissue or fluid extends from the posterior stomach wall into the gastrosplenic ligament (series 3 image 36), surrounds the left adrenal gland, and spleen, including the splenic hilum. Additional masslike soft tissue extension into the splenorenal space. No regional adenopathy. Normal spleen size.      Normal caliber duodenum, small bowel, and colon. Attention of the colon with gas and stool. Scattered small amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis. Anasarca.      Small bilateral nonobstructing renal calculi. Liver and pancreas are unremarkable. Cholelithiasis. No pneumoperitoneum. Normal caliber bowel. No adenopathy. Bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis. Mitral annular calcification. Atherosclerosis.      Age-indeterminate compression deformity of L1 with 50% loss of vertebral height body height. Matrix containing lesion in the right greater trochanter is most suggestive of a benign enchondroma.      Electronically signed by: J. F.

""" EXAM:  BI BREAST DIAGNOSTIC RIGHT WITH TOMOSYNTHESIS    INDICATION:  Abnormal screening mammogram; history of right breast malignancy in  2014 status post breast conservation therapy.    COMPARISON:  Prior exam(s) were available and reviewed for comparison.    DENSITY:  b. There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density.    FINDINGS:  Spot magnification views of the right breast were obtained. There is  a new 4 mm group of calcifications just anterior to the lumpectomy site.    IMPRESSION:  New right breast calcifications are suspicious of malignancy. These  also could represent benign fat necrosis however given the timeframe since the  prior malignancy, biopsy is recommended.    RECOMMENDATION:  Biopsy  Stereotactic biopsy of the right breast calcifications is recommended.    This  will be scheduled by the radiology Department.    ASSESSMENT:  BI-RADS: 4: Suspicious.

""" 10-Jun-2018 13:36:00  Exam: US Pelvis with Transvaginal   Indications: Cyst Adnexa   ORIGINAL REPORT - 10-Jun-2015 14:20:00   EXAM:  US Pelvis with Transvaginal      COMPARISON:  12/18/2017     IMPRESSION:   1. Previously seen right adnexal cyst is not identified today. The right ovary is visualized transabdominally and appears normal.   2. Adenomyosis, presumably related to tamoxifen therapy.      FINDINGS:   Technique:  Transabdominal and transvaginal.   Uterus:  5 x 6.5 x 10.5 cm. Nabothian cysts.   Uterus, myometrium: Several small uterine fibroids, with the largest being a subserosal fibroid on the left and measuring 3.4 x 3.5 x 3.3 cm.   Uterus, endometrium: Abnormal appearance of the endometrium which is thickened and has extensive cystic change. Bilayer thickness measures up to 12 mm. There are also subendometrial cysts. Appearance is consistent with adenomyosis, likely related to tamoxifen therapy in this patient. Endometrial polyp could also present with cystic change of the endometrium but would not be expected to have the subendometrial cystic change. No definite vascular stalk.   Right ovary:  Normal.     1.4 x 1.8 x 2.3 cm. Previously seen right adnexal cyst is not identified today.   Left ovary:  Normal. 1.7 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm   Free fluid:  None.
